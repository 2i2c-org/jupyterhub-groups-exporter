# jupyterhub-groups-exporter

An externally-managed JupyterHub service to export user group memberships to Prometheus.

## Overview

A common user story is that JupyterHub admins would like to monitor usage and costs segmented by user groups. This allows them to advocate for better cost recovery based on their own internal needs and funding models.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple, externally-managed JupyterHub service that exports user group memberships to Prometheus. This allows JupyterHub admins to monitor usage and costs segmented by user groups using visualization tools like Grafana.

## Installation
